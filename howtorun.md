## üìñ Overview

**Event Management Pro v5** is a demonstration web application built with plain PHP for managing events, user authentication, and RSVPs. It uses PDO for database interaction (supporting MySQL & SQLite) and incorporates basic security practices.

This README provides specific instructions on how to set up and run this project locally using popular development environments like **XAMPP** or **WAMP**.

**Note:** This is a demonstration project and requires further development and security hardening for production use.

## ‚ú® Features

*   User Registration & Login (Admin/User Roles)
*   Password Hashing
*   Admin Event Management (Create, Read, Update, Delete)
*   User Event RSVP & Cancellation System (with capacity checks)
*   Session Management
*   CSRF Protection & Output Escaping
*   PDO Database Interaction (MySQL/SQLite compatible)
*   Basic Templating & Frontend Styling
*   Automated Setup Script (`scripts/setup.sh`) - *Optional alternative setup described below*

## üõ†Ô∏è Technology Stack

*   **Backend:** PHP (7.4+)
*   **Database:** MySQL (MariaDB) or SQLite 3
*   **Frontend:** HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript (ES6+)
*   **Local Server:** XAMPP / WAMP (or similar like MAMP, Laragon)

## üöÄ Setup and Installation (XAMPP / WAMP)

Follow these steps to get the project running on your local machine using XAMPP or WAMP.

**Prerequisites:**

*   XAMPP or WAMP installed and running (ensure Apache and MySQL services are started).
*   A web browser.
*   Access to phpMyAdmin (usually included with XAMPP/WAMP).
*   A text editor or IDE.

**Steps:**

1.  **Download or Clone Project:**
    *   Obtain the project files (e.g., download a ZIP or clone if it's in a Git repository).
    *   Extract/place the entire project folder (e.g., `event_management_pro`) into the web server's document root directory:
        *   **XAMPP:** `C:\xampp\htdocs\` (or `/Applications/XAMPP/htdocs/` on macOS)
        *   **WAMP:** `C:\wamp\www\` or `C:\wamp64\www\`
        *   You should now have a path like `C:\xampp\htdocs\event_management_pro\`

2.  **Configure `config.php`:**
    *   Navigate to the `includes` directory within your project folder (e.g., `htdocs\event_management_pro\includes`).
    *   Open `config.php` in your text editor.
    *   **Choose Database Type:**
        *   Set `define('DB_TYPE', 'mysql');` (Recommended for XAMPP/WAMP default setup).
        *   *Alternatively, you could use 'sqlite', but the setup below focuses on MySQL.*
    *   **Configure MySQL Settings:**
        *   `define('DB_HOST', '127.0.0.1');` (or `localhost`) - Usually correct for XAMPP/WAMP.
        *   `define('DB_NAME', 'event_mgmt_pro_db');` - Choose a name for your database. You will create this in the next step.
        *   `define('DB_USER', 'root');` - Default XAMPP/WAMP MySQL username.
        *   `define('DB_PASS', '');` - Default XAMPP/WAMP MySQL password is often empty. **Set a password in a real environment!**
    *   **Verify `BASE_URL`:**
        *   Check if the auto-detected `BASE_URL` looks correct for your local setup (e.g., `http://localhost/event_management_pro/public/`).
        *   If not, **uncomment** the manual definition line and set it explicitly:
            ```php
            // Example: define('BASE_URL', 'http://localhost/event_management_pro/public/');
            ```
            Make sure it points to the `public` directory and ends with a slash (`/`).
    *   Save the changes to `config.php`.

3.  **Create and Import the Database (MySQL using phpMyAdmin):**
    *   Open your web browser and go to `http://localhost/phpmyadmin`.
    *   **Create Database:**
        *   Click on the "Databases" tab (or "New" on the left sidebar).
        *   In the "Create database" field, enter the exact database name you set in `config.php` (e.g., `event_mgmt_pro_db`).
        *   Choose a collation like `utf8mb4_unicode_ci`.
        *   Click "Create".
    *   **Import Schema:**
        *   Click on the newly created database name in the left sidebar to select it.
        *   Click on the "Import" tab at the top.
        *   Click the "Choose File" or "Browse..." button.
        *   Navigate to your project folder and go into the `scripts/` directory.
        *   Select the `mysql_schema.sql` file. *(**Note:** This file should have been generated by the original script or provided with the project. If not, you might need to run `scripts/setup.sh` in a bash environment first, or manually execute the SQL commands found within `scripts/initialize_db.php`)*.
        *   Ensure the character set is `utf8mb4`.
        *   Click the "Go" or "Import" button at the bottom. You should see success messages indicating tables (`users`, `events`, `rsvps`) were created.
    *   **(Optional) Import Sample Data:**
        *   If you want sample users and events, you can manually execute the `INSERT` statements found within the `scripts/insert_sample_data.php` file. Go to the "SQL" tab in phpMyAdmin (while your database is selected) and paste/run the relevant SQL insert commands.

4.  **(Alternative) Using the Setup Script (Requires Bash Environment):**
    *   If you have a bash environment available (like Git Bash on Windows, or WSL, or native Linux/macOS), you can use the provided setup script as an alternative to manual database creation/import.
    *   Ensure PHP CLI is available in your bash environment.
    *   Navigate to the `scripts` directory in your terminal: `cd /path/to/htdocs/event_management_pro/scripts`
    *   Make the script executable (if needed): `chmod +x setup.sh`
    *   Run the script: `./setup.sh`
    *   This script will read `config.php`, connect to MySQL, attempt to create the database and tables, and optionally insert sample data based on your prompts. **Ensure your MySQL service is running before executing.**

5.  **Run the Project:**
    *   Ensure Apache and MySQL services are running in your XAMPP/WAMP control panel.
    *   Open your web browser.
    *   Navigate to the `public` directory of your project via localhost. The URL should match the `BASE_URL` you verified/set:
        `http://localhost/event_management_pro/public/`
    *   You should see the Event Management Pro homepage.

## üíª Usage

*   Navigate the site to view events.
*   Register for a user account (`/public/register.php`).
*   Login (`/public/login.php`). Sample logins (if sample data imported):
    *   Admin: `admin` / `adminpass`
    *   User: `testuser` / `userpass`
    *   **(Change default passwords!)**
*   RSVP for events (as a user).
*   View your RSVPs on the dashboard (`/public/dashboard.php`).
*   Manage events via the admin panel (`/public/admin.php` - requires admin login).

##  troubleshooting

*   **`Access denied for user 'root'@'localhost'`:** Check the `DB_PASS` in `config.php`. XAMPP/WAMP default is often empty, but if you've set a MySQL root password, enter it there.
*   **`Unknown database 'event_mgmt_pro_db'`:** Ensure you created the database in phpMyAdmin (Step 3) with the exact name specified in `config.php`.
*   **`Table '...' doesn't exist`:** Make sure the database import (Step 3) was successful and created the `users`, `events`, and `rsvps` tables. Check phpMyAdmin. If using the setup script, review its output for errors.
*   **PHP Errors Displayed / Blank Page:**
    *   Check the Apache error log (`C:\xampp\apache\logs\error.log` or similar in WAMP).
    *   Check the PHP error log (`C:\xampp\php\logs\php_error_log` or enabled via `php.ini`).
    *   Check the project's `data/php_errors.log` (if configured).
    *   Ensure the required PHP extensions (PDO, pdo_mysql/pdo_sqlite) are enabled in your `php.ini` file (accessible via XAMPP/WAMP control panel).
*   **`Not Found` Errors:** Double-check the `BASE_URL` in `config.php` and ensure the URL you are visiting corresponds correctly to the `public` directory (e.g., `http://localhost/project_folder/public/`). Ensure `mod_rewrite` is enabled in Apache if you encounter issues related to URL routing (though this project doesn't heavily rely on it initially).
*   **Permission Errors (SQLite):** If using SQLite, ensure the `data/` directory within your project in `htdocs`/`www` is writable by the Apache process. Setting permissions in Windows can be tricky; sometimes running XAMPP/WAMP as Administrator can help (for local development only).
