## üõ†Ô∏è Technology Stack

*   **Backend:** PHP (7.4+)
*   **Database:** MySQL (MariaDB) or SQLite 3
*   **Frontend:** HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript (ES6+)
*   **Local Server:** XAMPP / WAMP (or similar like MAMP, Laragon)

## üöÄ Setup and Installation (XAMPP / WAMP)

Follow these steps to get the project running on your local machine using XAMPP or WAMP.

**Prerequisites:**

*   XAMPP or WAMP installed and running (ensure Apache and MySQL services are started).
*   A web browser.
*   Access to phpMyAdmin (usually included with XAMPP/WAMP).
*   A text editor or IDE.

**Steps:**

1.  **Download or Clone Project:**
    *   Obtain the project files (e.g., download a ZIP or clone if it's in a Git repository).
    *   Extract/place the entire project folder (e.g., `event_management_pro`) into the web server's document root directory:
        *   **XAMPP:** `C:\xampp\htdocs\` (or `/Applications/XAMPP/htdocs/` on macOS)
        *   **WAMP:** `C:\wamp\www\` or `C:\wamp64\www\`
        *   You should now have a path like `C:\xampp\htdocs\event_management_pro\`

2.  **Configure `config.php`:**
    *   Navigate to the `includes` directory within your project folder (e.g., `htdocs\event_management_pro\includes`).
    *   Open `config.php` in your text editor.
    *   **Choose Database Type:**
        *   Set `define('DB_TYPE', 'mysql');` (Recommended for XAMPP/WAMP default setup).
        *   *Alternatively, you could use 'sqlite', but the setup below focuses on MySQL.*
    *   **Configure MySQL Settings:**
        *   `define('DB_HOST', '127.0.0.1');` (or `localhost`) - Usually correct for XAMPP/WAMP.
        *   `define('DB_NAME', 'event_mgmt_pro_db');` - Choose a name for your database. You will create this in the next step.
        *   `define('DB_USER', 'root');` - Default XAMPP/WAMP MySQL username.
        *   `define('DB_PASS', '');` - Default XAMPP/WAMP MySQL password is often empty. **Set a password in a real environment!**
    *   **Verify `BASE_URL`:**
        *   Check if the auto-detected `BASE_URL` looks correct for your local setup (e.g., `http://localhost/event_management_pro/public/`).
        *   If not, **uncomment** the manual definition line and set it explicitly:
            ```php
            // Example: define('BASE_URL', 'http://localhost/event_management_pro/public/');
            ```
            Make sure it points to the `public` directory and ends with a slash (`/`).
    *   Save the changes to `config.php`.

3.  **Create and Import the Database (MySQL using phpMyAdmin):**
    *   Open your web browser and go to `http://localhost/phpmyadmin`.
    *   **Create Database:**
        *   Click on the "Databases" tab (or "New" on the left sidebar).
        *   In the "Create database" field, enter the exact database name you set in `config.php` (e.g., `event_mgmt_pro_db`).
        *   Choose a collation like `utf8mb4_unicode_ci`.
        *   Click "Create".
    *   **Import Schema:**
        *   Click on the newly created database name in the left sidebar to select it.
        *   Click on the "Import" tab at the top.
        *   Click the "Choose File" or "Browse..." button.
        *   Navigate to your project folder and go into the `scripts/` directory.
        *   Select the `mysql_schema.sql` file. *(**Note:** This file should have been generated by the original script or provided with the project. If not, you might need to run `scripts/setup.sh` in a bash environment first, or manually execute the SQL commands found within `scripts/initialize_db.php`)*.
        *   Ensure the character set is `utf8mb4`.
        *   Click the "Go" or "Import" button at the bottom. You should see success messages indicating tables (`users`, `events`, `rsvps`) were created.
    *   **(Optional) Import Sample Data:**
        *   If you want sample users and events, you can manually execute the `INSERT` statements found within the `scripts/insert_sample_data.php` file. Go to the "SQL" tab in phpMyAdmin (while your database is selected) and paste/run the relevant SQL insert commands.

4.  **(Alternative) Using the Setup Script (Requires Bash Environment):**
    *   If you have a bash environment available (like Git Bash on Windows, or WSL, or native Linux/macOS), you can use the provided setup script as an alternative to manual database creation/import.
    *   Ensure PHP CLI is available in your bash environment.
    *   Navigate to the `scripts` directory in your terminal: `cd /path/to/htdocs/event_management_pro/scripts`
    *   Make the script executable (if needed): `chmod +x setup.sh`
    *   Run the script: `./setup.sh`
    *   This script will read `config.php`, connect to MySQL, attempt to create the database and tables, and optionally insert sample data based on your prompts. **Ensure your MySQL service is running before executing.**

5.  **Run the Project:**
    *   Ensure Apache and MySQL services are running in your XAMPP/WAMP control panel.
    *   Open your web browser.
    *   Navigate to the `public` directory of your project via localhost. The URL should match the `BASE_URL` you verified/set:
        `http://localhost/event_management_pro/public/`
    *   You should see the Event Management Pro homepage.

## üíª Usage

*   Navigate the site to view events.
*   Register for a user account (`/public/register.php`).
*   Login (`/public/login.php`). Sample logins (if sample data imported):
    *   Admin: `admin` / `adminpass`
    *   User: `testuser` / `userpass`
    *   **(Change default passwords!)**
*   RSVP for events (as a user).
*   View your RSVPs on the dashboard (`/public/dashboard.php`).
*   Manage events via the admin panel (`/public/admin.php` - requires admin login).

##  troubleshooting

*   **`Access denied for user 'root'@'localhost'`:** Check the `DB_PASS` in `config.php`. XAMPP/WAMP default is often empty, but if you've set a MySQL root password, enter it there.
*   **`Unknown database 'event_mgmt_pro_db'`:** Ensure you created the database in phpMyAdmin (Step 3) with the exact name specified in `config.php`.
*   **`Table '...' doesn't exist`:** Make sure the database import (Step 3) was successful and created the `users`, `events`, and `rsvps` tables. Check phpMyAdmin. If using the setup script, review its output for errors.
*   **PHP Errors Displayed / Blank Page:**
    *   Check the Apache error log (`C:\xampp\apache\logs\error.log` or similar in WAMP).
    *   Check the PHP error log (`C:\xampp\php\logs\php_error_log` or enabled via `php.ini`).
    *   Check the project's `data/php_errors.log` (if configured).
    *   Ensure the required PHP extensions (PDO, pdo_mysql/pdo_sqlite) are enabled in your `php.ini` file (accessible via XAMPP/WAMP control panel).
*   **`Not Found` Errors:** Double-check the `BASE_URL` in `config.php` and ensure the URL you are visiting corresponds correctly to the `public` directory (e.g., `http://localhost/project_folder/public/`). Ensure `mod_rewrite` is enabled in Apache if you encounter issues related to URL routing (though this project doesn't heavily rely on it initially).
*   **Permission Errors (SQLite):** If using SQLite, ensure the `data/` directory within your project in `htdocs`/`www` is writable by the Apache process. Setting permissions in Windows can be tricky; sometimes running XAMPP/WAMP as Administrator can help (for local development only).

## üìñ Overview

This document outlines the development journey of the Event Management Application, showcasing its incremental evolution across three major versions (v1, v2, v3). The project progressed from a basic concept to a more structured, feature-rich, and secure web application designed for managing events and handling user interactions.

*   **Version 1:** Focused on establishing the foundational concept and basic functionality.
*   **Version 2:** Shifted towards improved code structure and acting primarily as an event "showcasing" platform.
*   **Version 3:** Matured into a professional, interactive platform incorporating industry-standard security practices, user authentication, event booking/RSVP capabilities, flexible database support, and an automated setup process.

## üöÄ Version Evolution

---

### Version 1: The Foundation

*   **Goal:** Proof-of-concept, basic event listing.
*   **Functionality:**
    *   Display a static or minimally dynamic list of events.
    *   Very basic page structure.
*   **Code Structure:**
    *   Likely monolithic PHP files or minimal includes.
    *   Primarily procedural code.
    *   Limited separation of concerns (HTML, CSS, PHP potentially mixed).
    *   Basic database connection (if any), possibly using older methods (e.g., `mysql_*` - deprecated).
*   **Security:** Minimal attention to security practices (e.g., no CSRF protection, potential SQL injection vulnerabilities, no output escaping).
*   **Setup:** Fully manual (copying files, creating database tables manually).

---

### Version 2: The Showcase & Structural Improvement

*   **Goal:** Enhance presentation, improve code organization, act as a display/portfolio page for events.
*   **Functionality:**
    *   Improved event listing and display (better styling, potentially basic filtering).
    *   Focus on showcasing event information rather than interaction (booking/RSVP might be absent or very basic).
    *   May include a simple way to update displayed event data (e.g., editing a data file or a very basic admin interface).
*   **Code Structure:**
    *   **Incremental Updates:** Introduction of more `include` files for reusable components (header, footer).
    *   Basic helper functions might be introduced.
    *   Slightly better separation of PHP logic and HTML presentation.
    *   Database interaction might be more organized, perhaps using early PDO concepts but not fully structured.
*   **Security:**
    *   **Incremental Updates:** Basic output escaping (`htmlspecialchars`) might be introduced to prevent simple XSS.
    *   Still lacking comprehensive security measures found in v3.
*   **Setup:** Still largely manual, but file organization might be slightly improved.

---

### Version 3: The Professional Platform (Event Management Pro v5)

*   **Goal:** Create a functional, interactive, and secure platform for managing events, user registrations, and RSVPs, adhering to better development practices and offering easier setup.
*   **Functionality:**
    *   **Full User Authentication:** Secure Registration, Login (Password Hashing), Logout, Role-based access (Admin vs User).
    *   **Event CRUD:** Admins can Create, Read, Update, and Delete events via a dedicated panel.
    *   **RSVP System:** Users can RSVP for events, cancel RSVPs, with checks against event capacity.
    *   **User Dashboard:** Users see events they have RSVP'd for.
    *   **Admin Panel:** Centralized event management.
    *   **Dynamic Event Listing & Details:** Displays upcoming/ongoing events, shows detailed views.
    *   **Flash Messages:** User feedback for actions (success, error, info).
*   **Code Structure:**
    *   **Modular Design:** Clear separation into `public/`, `includes/`, `data/`, `scripts/` directories.
    *   **Core Includes:** Dedicated files for `config.php`, `database.php` (PDO connection, session start), `functions.php` (reusable helpers).
    *   **Templating:** Simple but effective PHP templating (`renderTemplate`, partials like `header`, `footer`, `navbar`).
    *   **Database Abstraction:** Consistent use of **PDO** with **prepared statements**.
*   **Industry Standard Security Practices:**
    *   **CSRF Protection:** Implemented on all state-changing forms.
    *   **Password Hashing:** Uses `password_hash()` and `password_verify()`.
    *   **SQL Injection Prevention:** Relies entirely on PDO prepared statements.
    *   **XSS Prevention:** Consistent output escaping (`htmlspecialchars`).
    *   **Secure Sessions:** Configurable secure cookie parameters (HttpOnly, Secure, SameSite).
    *   **Directory Protection:** `.htaccess` rules prevent direct access to non-public directories.
*   **Database Flexibility & Schema:**
    *   **Dual DB Support:** Designed to work seamlessly with both **MySQL** and **SQLite** via configuration toggle (`config.php`).
    *   **Well-Defined Schema:** Clear structure for `users`, `events`, `rsvps` tables with appropriate relationships and constraints (Foreign Keys, `ON DELETE CASCADE`).
    *   **Schema Generation:** `initialize_db.php` creates the schema, and `mysql_schema.sql` is generated for reference/manual import if using MySQL.
*   **Automated Setup & Ease of Use:**
    *   **`setup.sh` Script:** Automates the database initialization process (table creation) based on `config.php`.
    *   **Optional Sample Data:** Script can populate the database with initial users and events for quick testing.
    *   **Clear Instructions:** Setup script provides guidance on configuration and next steps.
*   **Technology:** Mature PHP practices (strict types, PDO), structured CSS, minimal vanilla JavaScript for UI enhancements.

## üìñ Overview

This repository contains **Event Management Pro v5**, a web application developed as part of the **SithumSithara RUSL Applied Science Web Project**. Built with plain PHP, it demonstrates core web development principles for managing events, user authentication, and RSVPs.

The project emphasizes foundational PHP skills, database interaction via PDO (supporting MySQL/SQLite), basic security practices, and a structured approach without relying on a full framework. It provides a practical example of event listing, user registration/login, admin event management (CRUD), and user RSVP functionality.

**Context Note:** While the current version focuses on core CRUD and RSVP features, a potential future direction or related project context could involve integrating **interactive charts** (e.g., using Chart.js or ApexCharts) to visualize data such as event attendance trends, registration numbers over time, or service popularity, adding an analytical dimension to the event management data.

**Disclaimer:** This is a demonstration or educational project and is **not suitable for production deployment** without significant security hardening, feature expansion, and code review.

## ‚ú® Core Functionalities Implemented

This project showcases the following individual functionalities:

*   **Backend Structure:**
    *   **Modular Code:** Separation of concerns using `includes/` for configuration, database logic, helper functions, and templates.
    *   **Configuration Management:** Centralized settings in `config.php` (database type, credentials, paths, session parameters).
    *   **Database Abstraction (PDO):** Uses PHP Data Objects for database interaction, allowing easy switching between MySQL and SQLite.
    *   **Helper Functions:** A library (`functions.php`) providing reusable functions for:
        *   URL Generation (`baseUrl`)
        *   Redirection (`redirect`)
        *   Authentication Checks (`isAuthenticated`, `isAdmin`, `requireAuth`)
        *   Session Management (`logoutUser`, secure cookie parameters)
        *   Output Escaping (`escape`/`e` for XSS prevention)
        *   Flash Messaging (`setFlashMessage`, `getFlashMessage`)
        *   CSRF Protection (`generateCsrfToken`, `validateCsrfToken`)
        *   Basic Template Rendering (`renderTemplate`)
        *   Date Formatting (`formatDate`)
*   **Database & Schema:**
    *   **Relational Schema:** Defines tables for `users`, `events`, and `rsvps`.
    *   **Foreign Key Constraints:** Enforces relationships (e.g., RSVPs linked to users and events) with cascading deletes.
    *   **Automated Setup:** `scripts/setup.sh` orchestrates database initialization using `initialize_db.php`.
    *   **Sample Data:** Optional script (`insert_sample_data.php`) to populate the database with initial users and events.
*   **Authentication & Authorization:**
    *   **User Registration:** Allows new users to create accounts (`register.php`).
    *   **Password Security:** Uses `password_hash()` for secure password storage and `password_verify()` for comparison.
    *   **Session-Based Login:** Manages user sessions securely after successful login (`login.php`).
    *   **Logout:** Provides secure session termination (`logout.php`).
    *   **Role Management:** Simple distinction between `admin` and `user` roles stored in the database and session.
    *   **Access Control:** Protects routes/pages based on login status and user role (`requireAuth` function).
*   **Event Management (Admin CRUD):**
    *   **Create:** Admins can add new events with details like name, date, time, location, description, category, capacity, image URL (`event_edit.php`).
    *   **Read:** Admins can view a list of all events (`admin.php`) and details of specific events (`event_view.php`).
    *   **Update:** Admins can modify existing event details (`event_edit.php?id=...`).
    *   **Delete:** Admins can remove events, automatically cascading to remove associated RSVPs (`event_delete.php`).
*   **RSVP System (User Interaction):**
    *   **RSVP:** Logged-in regular users can RSVP to 'Upcoming' or 'Ongoing' events (`rsvp.php` action='rsvp').
    *   **Cancel RSVP:** Users can cancel their existing RSVP (`rsvp.php` action='cancel').
    *   **Capacity Check:** Prevents users from RSVPing to events that have reached full capacity.
    *   **Attendee Count:** Automatically increments/decrements the `attendees_count` on the `events` table within a transaction for data integrity.
    *   **User Dashboard:** Users can view a list of events they have RSVP'd for (`dashboard.php`).
*   **Frontend & UI:**
    *   **Templating:** Simple PHP includes for header, footer, navigation, and message display.
    *   **Basic Styling:** Uses CSS (`public/css/style.css`) for a dark theme, layout (Flexbox/Grid), basic component styling, and responsiveness.
    *   **JavaScript Enhancements:** Minimal vanilla JS (`public/js/script.js`) for confirmation dialogs, auto-hiding flash messages, and active nav link highlighting.
    *   **External Image Linking:** Supports linking event images via URL (field `image_url`).
*   **Basic Security:**
    *   **Directory Access Control:** `.htaccess` rules block direct web access to non-public directories.
    *   **CSRF Protection:** Tokens generated and validated for all state-changing forms.
    *   **XSS Prevention:** Output consistently escaped using `htmlspecialchars`.
    *   **SQL Injection Prevention:** Uses PDO prepared statements exclusively for database queries.
    *   **Secure Session Cookies:** Configured with `HttpOnly`, `Secure` (if HTTPS), and `SameSite` flags.
